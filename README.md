**Authors:** E. Falbel, I. Pasquinelli, A. Ucan-Puc

## Abstract

In the paper "Title of paper" we classify representations of a class of Deligne-Mostow lattices into PGL(3,C).
In particular, we show local rigidity of each representation.

Many of the proofs in the paper are computer assisted. 
This repository contains the code for these proofs. 

## Implementation

The code is a Jupyter Notebook in sage.
